# Musical Waves
This project utilized an FPGA to sample an ADC attached to a microphone to discretize audio samples, compute a real-time FFT, and display the FFT on an Adafruit 32x64 LED matrix.

# Note
I'm still working on packaging this project in a git-friendly way. Personal projects starting out never have clean git standards ;)
